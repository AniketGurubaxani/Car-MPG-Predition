# Car-MPG-Predition
The objective of this project is to predict car miles per gallon (MPG) using various statistical and machine learning techniques.
Result: This project achieved the prediction of car miles per gallon (MPG) using linear regression models. It identified that 'hp' and 'wt' are significant predictors of MPG, achieving an R-squared value of approximately 0.71 after removing outliers. Additionally, it demonstrated the importance of data cleaning and feature selection in improving model accuracy.
